# SESSION_NOTES.md — InkHeron Platform

**Rule (every session must honour this):** Keep this file under ~400 lines. When it grows
past that, move the OLDEST entries into `SESSION_NOTES_ARCHIVE.md` and keep only recent
sessions here. NEVER load the archive into context; grep it only when a specific past
decision needs checking.

**How to log:** newest entry at the TOP. One block per working session. Keep entries tight —
decisions and outcomes, not narration.

## 2026-06-25 — Phase 1 Step 1.2 server hardening
- Phase/Step worked: Phase 1, Step 1.2
- Built: Created `inkheron` non-root sudo user with SSH key access, set timezone to
  `Asia/Shanghai`, ran `apt-get update` and `apt-get upgrade`, enabled UFW with only 22, 80 and
  443 open.
- Decisions: Disabled root SSH login and password SSH. `inkheron` has passwordless sudo so remote
  maintenance still works with key-only auth.
- Open / next: Phase 1, Step 1.3 install/run Etherpad locally on port 9001.
- Gotchas hit: `/etc/ssh/sshd_config.d/50-cloud-init.conf` was forcing
  `PasswordAuthentication yes`; changed it to `no`. Hostname still reads
  `InkHeron--Speed-Dating-App`, which may need cleanup later.

## 2026-06-25 — Phase 1 Step 1 DNS verified
- Phase/Step worked: Phase 1, Step 1.1
- Built: Verified `inkpad.inkheron.app` A record resolves to `167.172.71.219`.
- Decisions: Target host is `inkpad.inkheron.app`, not apex `inkheron.app`.
- Open / next: Phase 1, Step 1.2 base server hardening.
- Gotchas hit: none.

## (template — delete this block once real entries exist)

## 2026-06-25 — Buildbook foundation created
- Phase/Step worked: pre-build setup
- Built: CLAUDE.md, buildbook/INDEX.md, this file. Student + teacher UI mockups already exist.
- Decisions: Writing portal is day-one; Tests portal later. SQLite. Node/Fastify wrapper.
  Singapore droplet. Porkbun DNS-only. Hashed passwords, teacher-reset only. Word count always on.
  Targets coach (explain), grammar codes answer-free, strengths expand. Paste detection day-one.
- Open / next: write remaining phase files (1–8), then begin Phase 1.
- Gotchas hit: none yet. (Watch: Caddy WebSocket headers for Etherpad; custom paste plugin is the
  main time-risk.)
